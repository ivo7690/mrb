    Architects and designers are always searching for the right materials to emphasise and embolden their projects. The versatility of marble makes it ideal for such a role, with a piece of specifically finished rock fitting seamlessly in to both modern and traditional designs. Techniques for crafting marble include: brushing, bush-hammering, flaming and polishing.
  </p><p>
    Consultants will help you plan how to use marble for your project, before collaborating with technicians to help you meticulously follow the whole process.
</p><p>
    We will oversee everything, from the block choice in the quarry, through to the shaping process undertaken by our specialist stoneworkers.
